//Restaurant Model
// - Name
// - Restaurant Category (static list to choose from?)
// - Address
//    - Distance from Rose (? - minutes and/or miles)
//    - If this is too hard we could just generate a link to google maps that shows directions from Rose to the restaurant
// - Price category (? - $ or $$ or $$$ for how pricey it is)
// - average rating out of 5 stars
// - Link to list of ratings

// I think the simplest action is we let users add a restaurant if it doesn't have have reviews yet
// and we trust the users to write accurate information and don't handle edit/delete.
